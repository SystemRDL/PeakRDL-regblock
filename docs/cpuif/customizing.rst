Customizing the CPU interface
=============================

Use your own existing SystemVerilog interface definition
--------------------------------------------------------

This exporter comes pre-bundled with its own SystemVerilog interface declarations.
What if you already have your own SystemVerilog interface declaration that you prefer?

Not a problem! As long as your interface definition is similar enough, it is easy
to customize and existing CPUIF definition.


As an example, let's use the SystemVerilog interface definition for
:ref:`cpuif_axi4lite` that is bundled with this project. This interface uses
the following style and naming conventions:

* SystemVerilog interface type name is ``axi4lite_intf``
* Defines modports named ``master`` and ``slave``
* Interface signals are all upper-case: ``AWREADY``, ``AWVALID``, etc...

Lets assume your preferred SV interface definition uses a slightly different naming convention:

* SystemVerilog interface type name is ``axi4_lite_interface``
* Modports are capitalized and use suffixes ``Master_mp`` and ``Slave_mp``
* Interface signals are all lower-case: ``awready``, ``awvalid``, etc...

Rather than rewriting a new CPU interface definition, you can extend and adjust the existing one:

.. code-block:: python

    from peakrdl_regblock.cpuif.axi4lite import AXI4Lite_Cpuif

    class My_AXI4Lite(AXI4Lite_Cpuif):
        @property
        def port_declaration(self) -> str:
            # Override the port declaration text to use the alternate interface name and modport style
            return "axi4_lite_interface.Slave_mp s_axil"

        def signal(self, name:str) -> str:
            # Override the signal names to be lowercase instead
            return "s_axil." + name.lower()

Then use your custom CPUIF during export:

.. code-block:: python

   exporter = RegblockExporter()
   exporter.export(
      root, "path/to/output_dir",
      cpuif_cls=My_AXI4Lite
   )



Custom CPU Interface Protocol
-----------------------------

If you require a CPU interface protocol that is not included in this project,
you can define your own.

1. Create a SystemVerilog CPUIF implementation template file.

    This contains the SystemVerilog implementation of the bus protocol. The logic
    in this shall implement a translation between your custom protocol and the
    :ref:`cpuif_protocol`.

    Reminder that this template will be preprocessed using
    `Jinja <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com>`_, so you can use
    some templating tags to dynamically render content. See the implementations of
    existing CPU interfaces as an example.

2. Create a Python class that defines your CPUIF

    Extend your class from :class:`peakrdl_regblock.cpuif.CpuifBase`.
    Define the port declaration string, and provide a reference to your template file.

3. Use your new CPUIF definition when exporting.
4. If you think the CPUIF protocol is something others might find useful, let me
   know and I can add it to PeakRDL!


Loading into the PeakRDL command line tool
------------------------------------------
There are two ways to make your custom CPUIF class visible to the
`PeakRDL command-line tool <https://peakrdl.readthedocs.io>`_.

Via the PeakRDL TOML
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The easiest way to add your cpuif is via the TOML config file. See the
:ref:`peakrdl_cfg` section for more details.

Via a package's entry point definition
--------------------------------------
If you are publishing a collecxtion of PeakRDL plugins as an installable Python
package, you can advertise them to PeakRDL using an entry point.
This advertises your custom CPUIF class to the PeakRDL-regblock tool as a plugin
that should be loaded, and made available as a command-line option in PeakRDL.

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 7-11

    import setuptools

    setuptools.setup(
        name="my_package",
        packages=["my_package"],
        # ...
        entry_points = {
            "peakrdl_regblock.cpuif": [
                'my-cpuif = my_package.__peakrdl_regblock__:MyCPUIF'
            ]
        }
    )


*   ``my_package``: The name of your installable Python module
*   ``peakrdl-regblock.cpuif``: This is the namespace that PeakRDL-regblock will
    search. Any cpuif plugins you create must be enclosed in this namespace in
    order to be discovered.
*   ``my_package.__peakrdl_regblock__:MyCPUIF``: This is the import path that
    points to your CPUIF class definition.
*   ``my-cpuif``: The lefthand side of the assignment is your cpuif's name. This
    text is what the end-user uses in the command line interface to select your
    CPUIF implementation.
