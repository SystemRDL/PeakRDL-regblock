Introduction
============

PeakRDL-regblock is a free and open-source control & status register (CSR) compiler.
This code generator translates your SystemRDL register description into
a synthesizable SystemVerilog RTL module that can be easily instantiated into
your hardware design.

* Generates fully synthesizable SystemVerilog RTL (IEEE 1800-2012)
* Options for many popular CPU interface protocols (AMBA APB, AXI4-Lite, and more)
* Configurable pipelining options for designs with fast clock rates.
* Broad support for SystemRDL 2.0 features


Quick Start
-----------
The easiest way to use PeakRDL-regblock is via the  `PeakRDL command line tool <https://peakrdl.readthedocs.io/>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Install PeakRDL-regblock along with the command-line tool
    python3 -m pip install peakrdl-regblock[cli]

    # Export!
    peakrdl regblock atxmega_spi.rdl -o regblock/ --cpuif axi4-lite
