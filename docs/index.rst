Introduction
============

PeakRDL-regblock is a free and open-source control & status register (CSR) compiler.
This code generator translates your SystemRDL register description into
a synthesizable SystemVerilog RTL module that can be easily instantiated into
your hardware design.

* Generates fully synthesizable SystemVerilog RTL (IEEE 1800-2012)
* Options for many popular CPU interface protocols (AMBA APB, AXI4-Lite, and more)
* Configurable pipelining options for designs with fast clock rates.
* Broad support for SystemRDL 2.0 features
* Fully synthesizable SystemVerilog. Tested on Xilinx/AMD's Vivado & Intel Quartus

.. warning::

    The PeakRDL-regblock SV generator is still in pre-production (v0.x version numbers).
    During this time, I may decide to refactor things which could affect compatibility.


Installing
----------

Install from `PyPi`_ using pip

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 -m pip install peakrdl-regblock

.. _PyPi: https://pypi.org/project/peakrdl-regblock



Example
-------
The easiest way is to use the `PeakRDL command line tool <https://peakrdl.readthedocs.io/>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Install the command line tool
    python3 -m pip install peakrdl

    # Export!
    peakrdl regblock atxmega_spi.rdl -o regblock/ --cpuif axi4-lite
